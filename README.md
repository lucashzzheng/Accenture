# Accenture
 Intership Programï¼ˆCase study)
## Ask 

The client is Social Buzz. This report aims to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

## Prepare

### Dataset selection

There are 7 datasets provided by the client. Our goal is to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity. Hence we need datasets which contains category information and a measure of popularity. From the data model file, Content and ReactionType datasets must be chose. Furthermore, we need a dataset to connect the two datasets which is the Reaction dataset. Hence, Content, Reaction and ReactionType are chose.

## Process

### Deletion of irrelevant columns

Content
- row_num removed
- user_id: we don't care which user gives the reaction in this report so removed.
- url removed

Reaction:
- row_num removed
- user_id: we don't care which user gives the reaction in this report so removed.
- dateframe: we don't care when user gives the reaction in this report so removed.

ReactionType:
- row_num removed
- sentiment: we only care about scoring in this report so removed.

### Merging of three datasets

Note that one content can have more than one reactions, so we should use reaction as left join table.
Reaction left join Content table on Content ID.
Reaction left join ReactionType table on Category.

### Removng Missing Value rows

- remove missing value reactiontype rows: 982 rows deleted. (Note that we only have approximate 25000 rows here, so almost 4% data deleted in this operation. If it is not required by the program, I will do the avearge scoring to replacing the missing value)
- remove missing value from null values of content_type and Categories, 2415 rows deleted.(this would not appear if left join is appiled)

22158 rows keep as clean data.
